# 🛒 Retail Orders Analysis

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of retail order data using both SQL and Python. It is designed to extract key business insights from historical sales records across regions, categories, and product lines. The analysis covers performance metrics, trend analysis, and comparative growth across time periods and segments.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Retail Orders Analysis.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that performs data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the retail dataset.
- `retail-orders-analysis-query-file.sql`: SQL script containing queries for creating the database, populating tables, and extracting valuable analytical insights.
